\bitcoin is the first fully-decentralized permissionless blockchain protocol to achieve a high level of security: the ledger it maintains has guaranteed liveness and consistency properties as long as the adversary has less compute power than the honest nodes. However, its throughput is only $7$ transactions per second and the confirmation latency can be up to hours. \prism is a new blockchain protocol that is designed to achieve a natural scaling of \bitcoin's performance while maintaining its full security guarantees. We present an implementation of \prism that achieves a throughput of over $70,000$ transactions per second and confirmation latency of tens of seconds on networks of up to $1000$ EC2 Virtual Machines. The code can be found at \cite{prismcode}.
